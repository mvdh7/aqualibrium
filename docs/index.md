# aqualibrium

**aqualibrium** is a Python 3.6+ library to solve the equilibrium condition for aqueous solutions, using a Pitzer model (as implemented by **pytzer**) to evaluate chemical activities.


# Development status

**aqualibrium** is in pre-alpha, and it interacts closely with **pytzer**, which is in beta. Use at your own peril!
